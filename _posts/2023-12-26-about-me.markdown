Meet me, Thomas Klijnman, a 26-year-old Flevoland native.

For the past four years,I’ve been part of the Pink Elephant family, currently rocking it as a System Engineer for office automation.

My focus revolves around the Pink Workplace, where I dive into different focus areas, such as identity management using Tools4Ever’s HelloID, configure the workplace with Liquit Workspace and the PSADT toolkit, and navigating the landscape of Microsoft Azure.

One of my current focus areas is navigating the vast landscape of the Microsoft Graph API. It’s here that I get to explore and implement new solutions to use in service automation setups and contributing to the technological backbone of Pink Ka.

Join me on this blog as I share insights, experiences, and challenges that come with current IT landscapes.
